The "main_widget" project is a series of widgets to create a new mobile view for controlling your openHAB installation.
For full functionality, you will need to install all widgets listed in the development thread.

Installation:
- If you want a specific ordering in the floors and/or rooms menu, please add the widgetOrderIndex as metadata to your items in the model.
